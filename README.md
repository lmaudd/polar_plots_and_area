# polar_plots_and_area
Python code that can plot, shade, and compute area in polar coordinates.

polar_plotting_and_area.py has three functions. pplot() plots a function in terms of theta (r = sin(theta), for example). pshade() has the same functionality as pplot(), but it fills the plot
in. One potential issue is plotting some polar shapes with inner loops, like some limacon (the inner loop is shaded in). polar_area() determines the area enclosed within a polar function in terms of r by utilizing double
integrals. 

integration.py has two functions, one for computing single integrals and one for double integrals (both in cartesian coordinates).
