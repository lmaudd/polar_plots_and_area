# polar_plots_and_area
Python code that can plot, shade, and compute area in polar coordinates.

polar_plotting_and_area.py has three functions. pplot() plots a function in terms of theta (r = sin(theta), for example). pshade() has the same functionality as pplot(), but it fills the plot
in. One potential issue with  plotting some polar shapes with inner loops, like some limacon. polar_area() determines the area enclosed within a polar function in terms of r by utilizing double
integrals. 

integration.py has two functions, one for computing single integrals and one for double integrals (both in cartesian coordinates).
